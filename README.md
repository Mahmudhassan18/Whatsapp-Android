Start by cloning the repository to android studio.<br />
Then clone the repotiroy of the server to visual studio:<br />
https://github.com/GitBitWheat/ap2ex3_server.git<br />
Run both projects.<br />

Firebase wasn't implemented.<br />
Note that our computers weren't powerful enough to run both projects at the same time.<br />
We tried to upload the server to the university servers, but we didn't succeed in doing so.<br />
Because of that, some of the code here wasn't tested.<br />
We would be grateful if you could go through the code yourselves and grade us according to our efforts.
